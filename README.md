# gym_frontend

frontend project for a gym scheduling and history tracking app.
The backend for the project is built with django/python and is available here <https://github.com/lewis-kori/gym-app>.

The project utilizes google calendar API to schedule appointments and reminders.

Chart.js has been used to highlight a visual representation of the person's workout history.

NB: The project is still under active development and as yet not yet complete.
